# Rosetta Translations Framework

This is a framework mod aimed to facilitate translating Battle Brother mods to various languages. Design goals:

- be easy to use - both original translation and subsequent updates
- untie translation cycle from mod release cycle
- allow translations to be shippped as a translation author prefers: as a separate mod, as a part of a translated mod, as a bundle translating several things
- no centrally managed infrastracture

Currently all the translation is done in squirrel by intercepting strings either at the squirrel/js border or earlier if that is easier to implement.

Or just a thing to take the place of lacking Squirrel/Battle Brothers standard library. An assortment of various utils to help coding mods. If you here first time I suggest starting from the [Usage](#usage) section.
